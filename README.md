## Scope and Purpose of Project

For Project 2, the project team will be working off the findings in Project 1 (github link here: https://github.com/NatashaPredov/Project-1-.git) to further understand how the learnings from the last few Module's can work to benefit those applying them in real life situations. 

To summarize the scope from Project 1: 
- Wanted to investigate and determine a predictive model for the long term behaviour of relatively stable ETFs.
- Wanted understand how this model would react and change due to the unforseen impacts the COVID-19 pandemic had on the Canadian Banks. 
- The timeframe of the model data that the team will be analyzing covers 4 years: August 2016 through July 2020. While the validation data will cover: August 2019 through July 2020 - 6 months before and after the February 2020 COVID-19 crash. Due to this being unforseen and very out of the ordinary, the team will be ignoring the data up until Feb 2020 then picking our analysis back up 6 months post crash.

Now to extend from Project 1, Project 2's scope entails that the project team wanted to try to trade BNS in a way that would beat a buy and hold strategy relative to the other correlated bank stocks. The y variable, which is the target variable is the Bank of Nova Scotia stock otherwise represented henseforth as BNS. 

The baseline, that will represent the buy and hold strategy will come from the Monte Carlo simulation from BNS with its CI closer to the top end of CI. 

To ensure we meet the technical requirements of project 2, we will be using google colab (link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oMDA37RPqLsV02G0zDd6kaWDExMvUDVi) to work in an Agile framework methedology to prepare a training and testing dataset. 

For this project we will be creating three machine learning models to fit and apply the data to, to determine which model returns the best trading performance.

To view this project, follow the main branch found in this Github repo to the final code that encompasses all of the contributions made by the team members.

The code which is submitted is commented with concise, relevant notes that other developers can understand so future extensions on the work submitted can be explored if needed.


## Technical Requirements
The technical requirements for Project 2 are as follows:
- (DONE) Create a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.
- Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.
- Create one or more machine learning models.
- Fit the model(s) to the training data.
- Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.
- Show the predictions using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.
- Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.
- Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.


 Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
