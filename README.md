## Scope and Purpose of Project
- y varible (target) is BNS
- trying to trade BNS (trading strategy) in a way that will beat a buy and hold strategy relative to the other correlated bank stocks 
- Baseline: buy and hold would be from the Monte Carlo from BNS with its CI (closer to the top end of the CI)
- Create 3 models to be this prediction 
- 1: machine learning 2. AI model/neural network 3. TBD (supervised learning/unsupervised learning
- outcome: which model does the best at predicting - returns the best trading performance

## Technical Requirements
The technical requirements for Project 2 are as follows:
- (DONE) Create a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.
- Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.
- Create one or more machine learning models.
- Fit the model(s) to the training data.
- Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.
- Show the predictions using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.
- Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.
- Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.


 Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
